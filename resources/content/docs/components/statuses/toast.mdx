## Basic
This is the basic toast component.
First, in your root app component, import the Toast component.
```tsx
import { Toast } from 'ui';
```
Then, add the Toast component to your app.
```tsx
const App = () => {
  return (
    <Toast />
  );
};
```
And next, just use the `toast()` function to show a toast.

## Installation
<InstallCommand isAdd items={['toast']}/>

## Composed Components
<Composed components={['button']}/>

## Manual Installation
<InstallCommand isInstall isManual items={['react-aria-components', 'sonner', '@irsyadadl/paranoid']}/>
<SourceCode toShow={['toast']}/>


## Next.js
If you're slapping this toast into your Next.js gig, you're gonna wanna roll with the `next-themes` package to flip the theme on that toast. Peep how you hook it up:

<InstallCommand isInstall isManual items={['next-themes']}/>

Don't forget to jam a theme provider component in there. Scope out the setup [here](/docs/dark-mode/next-js).

## Inertia.js
When you're rocking this toast with Inertia.js, it's all cool if you've got your theme provider locked down. If not, no sweatâ€”catch the how to [right here](/docs/dark-mode/inertia-js).

## Description
When you wanna flash a toast with a title and a description, the style game is strong. The title beefs up, gets all bold and big if there's a description. No stressin' over that it's handled for ya.

## Positions
Toast can be positioned in four different places.
<How toUse="statuses/toast-positions-demo" />

## Status
Toast can be positioned in four different positions.
<How toUse="statuses/toast-status-demo" />

## Action
Toast can be positioned in four different positions.
<How toUse="statuses/toast-action-demo" />

## Expand
Toast can be expanded to show more content.
```tsx
<Toast expand />
```

## Hide Icon
When this toast has status like `success`, `warning` etc, the icon is shown by default. But if you want to disable the icon for a specific toast, you can do it like this.
```tsx {2-5}
toast.success(`Copied ${text} to clipboard`, {
  classNames: {
    toast: '[&:has([data-icon])_[data-content]]:ml-0',
    icon: 'hidden'
  }
})
```
You can shut it down straight from the component if you wanna nuke it completely. But sometimes it looks funky when you're dealing with toast promises or loading.

## Don't close automatically
Sometimes you don't want the toast to close automatically. For example, say you have a toast that waits for a user to click a button. You don't want the toast to close automatically when the user clicks the button.

You can do it like this.
```tsx {2}
toast('Someone requested to delete this product', {
    duration: Infinity,
    cancel: {
        label: 'Cancel',
        onClick: () => alert('Cancelled')
    },
    action: {
        label: 'Delete',
        onClick: () => alert('Deleted')
    },
})
```
