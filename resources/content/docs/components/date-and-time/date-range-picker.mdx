## Validation
Ensure that the date range picker is properly filled out by using the `isRequired` prop.

## Custom Validation
Use the `validate` function to implement custom validation rules. It evaluates the current date range and returns error messages if the value doesn't meet your criteria.

## Disabled
When the date range picker is disabled, it becomes non-interactive and is visually represented in a disabled state.
