title: "Keyboard"
description: Keyboard and focus support's gotta be tight so folks can cruise through your app using just the keys. It’s clutch for those who can’t rock a mouse or touchscreen, but power users dig it too speedy nav without ever leaving the keyboard.

## Basic
There’s not much to showcase here, but you can explore related components such as the [Menu](/docs/components/collections/menu) and [CommandMenu](/docs/components/controls/command-menu).

<Note>
  Just a heads up: incorporating components like **menu** or **command** automatically integrates the keyboard component as well. There’s no need to install it separately.
