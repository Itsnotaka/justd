## Controlled
When you got that color field on lock, the [ColorSwatch](/docs/components/colors/color-swatch) auto-updates to show the current color.

By default, you can click the color swatch to pop open the color picker. But if you wanna shut it down, just set `enableColorPicker` to false.
```
<ColorField enableColorPicker={false}/>
```

A color field can be disabled.
