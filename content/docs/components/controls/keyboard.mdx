## Basic
Ain’t nothin' to peep here, but you can hit up the [Menu](/docs/components/collections/menu), [Command](/docs/components/controls/command)and more.

<Note>
  Yo, just a heads up: snagging the related component like **menu**, **command** automatically hooks you up with the dropdown component too. No need to sweat installing it on its own.
