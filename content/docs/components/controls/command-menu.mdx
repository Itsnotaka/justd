## Basic
This command menu is straightforward, always under your control, allowing you to open and close it as needed.
<How toUse="controls/command-menu-demo" />

## Installation
<InstallCommand isAdd items={['command-menu-menu']} />

## Composed Components
<Composed components={['keyboard', 'separator']} />

## Manual Installation

<InstallCommand isInstall isManual items={['react-aria-components', 'cmdk', '@irsyadadl/paranoid']} />

<SourceCode toShow={['command']} />

## Separator
You can toss a separator between items.
<How toUse="controls/command-menu-separator-demo" />

## Section
You can rock the command solo, no sections needed, but for real, it’s smart to use sections.
<How toUse="controls/command-menu-section-demo" />

## Keyboard
You can hook up a keyboard to the command. Heads up though, the keyboard might duck out on smaller screens.
<How toUse="controls/command-menu-keyboard-demo" />

## Trigger by Keyboard
You can trigger a command by keyboard. This is a great way to get started with command palettes.
<How toUse="controls/command-menu-trigger-by-keyboard-demo" />

## Danger
You can crank up the heat on a command item, make it dangerous. That’ll switch the item’s color to red, signaling caution.
<How toUse="controls/command-menu-danger-item-demo" />

## Controlled
You can control the value of the command palette by using the `value` and `onValueChange` props. This is a great way to make a command palette that is controlled by a parent component.
<How toUse="controls/command-menu-controlled-demo" />
For sure, you can also manage the value of the item, like say you wanna kick off some action after picking an item.
```
<CommandItem onSelect={() => console.log('share justd.co/d/command')} />
```

## Disabled
When you flip it to disabled, it'll go gray and won't be clickable, just sitting there all chill.
<How toUse="controls/command-menu-disabled-demo" />

## Hide Indicator
You can hide the search indicator by passing `hideSearchIndicator` and close button by passing `hideCloseButton`. The demo you can see on [Command Description](#description) section.
```
<CommandMenu
  hideCloseButton
  hideSearchIndicator
  isOpen={isOpen}
  onOpenChange={setIsOpen}
/>
```

## Description
Sometimes you gotta slap a description on a command item. Hook it up using the `CommandDescription` component. Just a heads up, the keyboard might dip out on smaller screens.
<How toUse="controls/command-menu-description-demo" />

## Fallback Empty Message
By default, it will show a message when "No results found.". If you think you want to change the message, you can do that by passing a string to `messageOnEmpty` prop.
```
<Command messageOnEmpty='There are no results'/>
```
Or maybe you wanna make a custom empty message, you can turn it off by passing `false`. And make your own empty message like this.
```
<Command
  messageOnEmpty={false}
  hideCloseButton
  hideSearchIndicator
  isOpen={isOpen}
  onOpenChange={setIsOpen}
>
  <CommandInput placeholder="Search for apps and commands..." />
  <CommandEmpty className="grid place-content-center">
    <div className="text-center">
      <IconCube className="inline" />
      <p className="mt-2">No results found.</p>
    </div>
  </CommandEmpty>
  ...
</Command>
```
And again, you can see the demo on [Command Description](#description) section. Try typing anything that doesn't match the option and see what happens.

## Navigating
For sure, when you're rolling with this command as a link in client-side frameworks like Next.js or Inertia.js, you might wanna auto close the command palette once you hit the link. I got an example on how you can make that happen.

### Inertia.js
When using Inertia.js, you can use the `router.on('navigate')` to close the command palette when you navigate to a new page.
```tsx {14}
export function CommandPalette({ open, setOpen }: Props) {
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const down = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
      if (e.key === 'k' && (e.metaKey || e.ctrlKey)) {
        e.preventDefault()
        setOpen((open: boolean) => !open)
      }
    }

    document.addEventListener('keydown', down)

    return () => document.removeEventListener('keydown', down)

    router.on('navigate', () => setOpen(false))
  }, [pathname, setOpen])
  return (...)
```
### Next.js
When using Next.js, you can use the `usePathname` hook to close the command palette when you navigate to a new page.
```tsx {2} {14}
export function CommandPalette({ open, setOpen }: Props) {
  const pathname = usePathname()
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const down = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
      if (e.key === 'k' && (e.metaKey || e.ctrlKey)) {
        e.preventDefault()
        setOpen((open: boolean) => !open)
      }
    }

    document.addEventListener('keydown', down)

    return () => document.removeEventListener('keydown', down)
  }, [pathname, setOpen])
  return (...)
```
