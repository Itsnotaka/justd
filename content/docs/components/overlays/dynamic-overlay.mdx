## Basic
Thereâ€™s not much to see here, but you can check out the [Date Picker](/docs/components/date-and-time/date-picker) and [Color Picker](/docs/components/colors/color-picker) documentation for more details.

<Note>
  Just a heads up: when you grab components like `date-picker` or `color-picker`, the dynamic-overlay component gets included automatically. No need to worry about installing it separately.
