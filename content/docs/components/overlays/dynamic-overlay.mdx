## Basic
Ainâ€™t nothin' to peep here, but you can hit up the [Date Picker](/docs/components/date-and-time/date-picker) and [Color Picker](/docs/components/colors/color-picker) docs for the deets.

<Note>
  Yo, just a heads up: snagging the date-picker or color-picker automatically hooks you up with the dynamic-overlay component too. No need to sweat installing it on its own.
