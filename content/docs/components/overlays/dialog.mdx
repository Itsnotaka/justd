## Basic
Ainâ€™t nothin' to peep here, but you can hit up the [Modal](/docs/components/overlays/modal) and [Color Picker](/docs/components/colors/color-picker) docs for the deets.

<Note>
  Yo, just a heads up: snagging the related component like modal, sheet or color-picker automatically hooks you up with the dialog component too. No need to sweat installing it on its own.
